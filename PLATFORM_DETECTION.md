# Platform Detection

Based on your screenshot, you're on a deployment platform. Let me help identify which one:

## Possible Platforms:

### Render (Most Likely)
- UI matches Render's interface
- "Hobby" plan is Render's free tier
- Good for Next.js deployments

### Railway
- Also has similar UI
- "Hobby" plan available
- Good for full-stack apps

### Other Platforms
- Could be other Git-based deployment platforms

---

## Next Steps Based on Platform:

### If Render:
1. Click "Create" button
2. Configure build settings
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### If Railway:
1. Click "Create" button
2. Add PostgreSQL database
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

### If Vercel:
1. Different UI - should see "Import Project" instead
2. Follow Vercel-specific steps

**Please confirm which platform you're using so I can provide exact steps!**
