    "content": "Situation: Promoters wanted Pita Pit to expand through high-footfall malls with a dinner-first strategy. Early data showed this wasn't working—dinner demand was weak, and high rentals crushed margins. Task: Reevaluate market entry strategy and convince senior leadership to pivot away from malls toward data-backed micro-markets. Action: Analyzed Zomato/Swiggy patterns, walk-in trends, dayparts, and customer cohorts. Segmented customers into three personas (Health Freaks, Aspirants, Intuitives) and AOV tiers (LA/MM/UM). Mapped demand to gyms, corporates, youth markets, and food courts—NOT malls. Communicated a clear, fact-based recommendation to pivot the entire rollout strategy. Result: Leadership approved the pivot. Forecast accuracy improved 25%, unit economics strengthened, and the 100-outlet rollout became viable.",

Task: Get full buy-in for the new SOPs and establish credibility as a leader, without creating resentment or friction. Action: Held 1:1 conversations to understand their concerns without interrupting. Shared data on inconsistency, customer complaints, and prep-time variance to bring objectivity. We co-created SOPs through three drafts, incorporating field feedback. Set up weekly follow-ups so area managers felt ownership, and publicly credited them for improvements once results started coming in. Result: New SOPs were fully adopted, product variance reduced significantly, outlet consistency improved.

Redesigned controls: disabled manual UPI entry, added POS reconciliation checks, introduced camera visibility, and implemented surprise audits and dual-approval for voided bills.

    "content": "Most decisions followed a 3-layer framework: 1. Customer Perception First - How will the customer interpret this decision digitally vs physically? Will this increase perceived value, trust, or convenience? 2. Unit Economics Second - Does this improve AOV, reduce fixed costs, or shorten payback? If it increases cost, can it be reused across multiple outlets? 3. Scalability Third - Can this be standardized? Can this be documented and handed over to future teams? This framework governed decisions such as photography investment, multi-format kitchens, premium menu introduction, humanizing the brand, pop-up pilots, WhatsApp ordering.",
