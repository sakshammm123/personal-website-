The promoters wanted Pita Pit to expand through high-footfall malls with a dinner-first strategy. Early data showed this wasn’t working—dinner demand was weak, and high rentals crushed margins.
T — Task
Reevaluate market entry strategy and convince senior leadership to pivot away from malls toward data-backed micro-markets.
A — Action
You analyzed Zomato/Swiggy patterns, walk-in trends, dayparts, and customer cohorts.
You segmented customers into three personas (Health Freaks, Aspirants, Intuitives) and AOV tiers (LA/MM/UM).
Mapped demand to gyms, corporates, youth markets, and food courts—NOT malls.
Communicated a clear, fact-based recommendation to pivot the entire rollout strategy.
R — Result
Leadership approved the pivot.
Forecast accuracy improved 25%, unit economics strengthened, and the 100-outlet rollout became viable.

R — Result
Service quality maintained 95%+, complaints reduced, and the visibility boost significantly expanded your customer base.
 
3. Multi-Format Kitchen Model Redesign
Competencies: Leadership + Strategic Problem Solving
S — Situation
Canadian store design was expensive, equipment-heavy, and unsuitable for India—leading to 18-month payback periods.
T — Task
Redesign outlet formats to reduce capex, rents, and complexity for Indian rollouts.
A — Action
You did machinery ROI analysis, removed three low-return machines, and introduced five new store formats: cloud kitchen, café, kiosk, food court, takeaway.

Wastage was very high due to strict freshness SOPs and full-look counters.
T — Task
Reduce wastage without hurting product quality or customer experience.
A — Action
You created a gamified Zero-Waste Challenge with cash incentives.
Empowered store managers to innovate (smaller cambros, smarter cutting cycles, peak hour anticipation).
Standardized the best ideas.
R — Result
Wastage reduced 30–34%, morale improved, and stores became more efficient.
 
5. Pilot Testing to Validate GTM Assumptions (1,000+ consumers)
Competencies: Initiative + Flexibility
S — Situation
Menu engineering and SOPs were theoretical and untested.
Rolling out across NCR without validation was risky.

Customer behavior data from the second outlet showed inconsistent price sensitivity.
Some customers cared much more about protein than price.
T — Task
Create a tiered menu architecture that allowed price discrimination without losing affordability for lower-AOV segments.
A — Action
You segmented customers by AOV tiers and health personas.
Introduced a premium “Extra Healthy” high-protein line, increased protein content 50–60%, added air-fried sides and protein shakes.
Bundled them into full meal combos.
R — Result
AOV increased 15–20%, customers ordered full meals, and unit-level contribution improved.
 
7. Humanizing the Brand With Chef Story Cards & QR Reels
Competencies: Communication + Empathy + Problem Solving
S — Situation
As a digital-first QSR, customers lacked trust—leading to exaggerated complaints (e.g., one drop of sauce being labeled a “spillage”).
T — Task
Increase perceived value, reduce complaints, and build emotional connection without increasing cost.
A — Action
You created personalized chef cards with their photo, a short story, and a QR code linking to Instagram reels about their lives.

Canadian photos didn’t resonate with Indian customers.
Your manager refused a professional shoot due to high cost and low early sales.
T — Task
Prove—using data—that better photos directly improve product perception and sales.
A — Action
You enhanced the image of a new Paneer Tikka SKU using a graphic designer and listed it online.
The SKU instantly became a bestseller.
You compiled data and presented a clear ROI case.
R — Result
Budget approved within a month. Impression to menu ^
Professional photoshoot executed.
Sales increased and visuals became reusable assets across all future outlets.
 
9. Protein Shake Line Using a Shaker Instead of a Blender
Competencies: Innovation + Problem Solving + Flexibility
S — Situation
High-protein beverages were in demand but the kitchen redesign left zero space for a smoothie blender.
Adding one would break capex and workflow.
T — Task
Launch protein shakes without adding machinery, cost, or space.
A — Action
During a trip to Goa, you saw bartenders preparing cocktails using only shakers.
This inspired a workaround:
•	developed a shaker-based protein shake SOP
•	tested textures/flavors
•	trained staff
•	launched multiple flavors
•	integrated shakes into full-meal bundles
R — Result
Protein shakes launched with zero capex, strong adoption, and meaningful contribution to the 5-10% AOV uplift.


⭐ 10. SOP Discipline & Earning Authority as a Young Leader
Competencies: Leadership + Communication + Conflict Resolution
S — Situation
I was significantly younger than many of the area managers who had spent years in the QSR industry. While they didn’t say anything openly, their behaviour showed they were undermining my authority—escalating decisions to my manager without speaking to me, and resisting the stricter SOPs I introduced to reduce product variance.
T — Task
Get full buy-in for the new SOPs and establish credibility as a leader, without creating resentment or friction.
A — Action
I held 1:1 conversations to understand their concerns without interrupting.
I shared data on inconsistency, customer complaints, and prep-time variance to bring objectivity.
We co-created SOPs through three drafts, incorporating field feedback.
I set up weekly follow-ups so the area managers felt ownership, and publicly credited them for improvements once results started coming in.
R — Result
The new SOPs were fully adopted, product variance reduced significantly, and outlet consistency improved.
More importantly, the working relationship strengthened — the managers began involving me proactively in decisions, and my credibility increased across the team.
 
⭐ 11. Anti-Theft Action & Rebuilding Governance Systems
Competencies: Ethical Judgment + Leadership + Operational Discipline
S — Situation
One of our store managers was caught routing customer payments to his personal UPI ID. Keeping him temporarily would have kept the store running, but sent the wrong message to the entire organisation.
T — Task
Take immediate action to reinforce integrity across the system, while managing the operational disruption that would follow.
A — Action
I made the difficult decision to terminate him mid-shift with zero notice.
We shut the outlet and transferred all fresh produce to neighbouring stores to prevent wastage.
I redesigned controls: disabled manual UPI entry, added POS reconciliation checks, introduced camera visibility, and implemented surprise audits and dual-approval for voided bills.
R — Result
Theft incidents dropped to zero across all outlets thereafter.
Financial leakages were eliminated, and store managers became far more disciplined.
The incident clearly reinforced the culture that integrity was non-negotiable.
 
⭐ 12. Corporate Membership Program for Lunchtime Sales
Competencies: Commercial Insight + Business Development
S — Situation
Lunch-time walk-ins were low despite being surrounded by offices, and aggregator commissions made afternoon delivery margins thin.
T — Task
Create a direct, high-volume lunchtime channel that reduced aggregator dependence.
A — Action
I designed a corporate membership program where employees received 10–15% lunch discounts.
Verification was done using visiting cards, which were then fed into the POS for tracking.
We conducted targeted outreach via WhatsApp and in-office sampling.
R — Result
Lunchtime footfall increased sharply, direct orders rose, and aggregator reliance reduced.
The program became a predictable recurring revenue channel, especially for outlets in office-dense areas.
 
⭐ 13. Pre-Launch Brand Seeding & Early Customer Acquisition
Competencies: Marketing Strategy + Customer Understanding
S — Situation;
Before entering NCR, awareness of Pita Pit India was zero, and most digital-first brands struggled to generate early traction without physical presence.
T — Task
Build brand recall and acquire early customers even before the first outlet opened.
A — Action
We launched pre-opening campaigns on social media featuring brand storytelling and behind-the-scenes content.
Many customers who had lived abroad recognised the brand and engaged with the content.
We also ran targeted WhatsApp communication to people near our launch location.
R — Result
We built a customer base before launch, with people visiting in the first week who had already interacted with the brand online.
This reduced the typical “ramp-up period” that new outlets face and contributed to early momentum.
 
⭐ 14. Data Culture Transformation With Power BI
Competencies: Analytical Thinking + Execution + Process Improvement
S — Situation
The organisation was dependent on intuition and monthly reports. This led to slow reaction time, inconsistent decisions, and lack of accountability.
T — Task
Introduce a data-driven operating rhythm and bring real-time visibility into performance.
A — Action
I implemented Power BI dashboards tracking delays, cancellations, complaints, SKU performance, and kitchen prep-time behaviour.
Area managers were trained to review data daily and send summaries.
We made staffing reallocations and operational fixes based on real-time patterns.
R — Result
Decision-making became faster and more objective.
Delays reduced, customer experience improved, and the organisation gradually shifted from intuition-based to data-driven operations.

What percent of this ₹50L came from:
Zomato/Swiggy 70%
Walk-ins 20%
Corporate orders 5%
Your new marketing interventions? 5%
I was leading the strategy and business — Mr Manoj was heading the operation, Mohit was the general manager, Rajkumar and Shambhu were area heads who reported to Manoj and me, food quality and innovation team led by Ankush  Social media team Taha and Talha looked after making content, social media activation, influencer marketing, and graphic designing. There were store managers for each outlet, some had assistant store managers as well which had 2 peak timings.
How many direct reports did you have? Ankush, Dheeraj and Komal, Taha and Talha, Rajesh and Shambhu. Basically the store team through the area managers, social media team, analytics team and the food quality and innovation team.
What specific insights did you uncover — we had categorised our customers by 2 divisions: paying power (Zomato–UM–400+ (order sides, products out of order, hard to gain loyalty, high quality expectations), MM–AOV 250–400 discounting is a push, consistency sensitive, frequent orderers, and LA–AOV 150–250, discount sensitive, low brand loyalty) — and our 3 personas: Health freaks (people who care a lot about what they are putting in their body, care a lot about the grams of protein in their meal, order without sauces or dressing as it contains. They were sensitive about the quality of food, didn’t care about the taste as much). The aspirants (they were the people who try to replace food for something healthy, but don’t want compromise on taste, they look for a health centric product not a healthy product. They’re the people who avoid deep fried food but are okay with having a lot of carbs and are actually not very picky about the amount of protein etc. A key trait about them is that they are very specific about the taste and they don’t actually care about the protein etc). And the intuitives (these are the people who are ordering because they’re intrigued by the menu, not because of the health-centric food statement. They look at other traits like freshness, flavour profiles, and maybe how innovative the product is. These are some people who also are enthusiasts about Lebanese food and might order falafel. So they don’t care about the fact that a falafel is not fried. So a few issues that we faced with them is that a few compromises we make deliberately on the taste — they do not appreciate that.)
What marketing actions came directly from those insights?
I will give you an example. Customer retention is a key issue for online orders specially when it’s not a direct order. So we started adding inserts to our packaging when we sent out the order. While understanding what we should add we had a lot of ideas, and a lot of ideas we tried. We initially brainstormed about what we want to communicate through the packaging inserts and we came up to thank you notes, our menu itself, along with handwritten notes and posters etc. So we understood that all of these different things would influence different types of customers in a unique way. So we divided into two basic categories: anything under the order value of 350 rupees we put in a pamphlet which gave them extra discount if they order directly from us and that communication was through a QR code along with the pamphlet which redirected them directly to our WhatsApp ordering portal. For orders more than 350 rupees we put in a thank you note which looked like it was a handwritten note — it was a photocopy, a black and white photocopy — and we actually got a lot of good feedback. All of these notes were customized, written by the cook themselves and each cook had their own personal note to give out.
What is the #1 thing YOU did that actually drove the ₹50L?
I think one important thing that I added to the business that would not have been there if it wasn’t for me — within the first one month of operation I introduced using data within the business. We hired a consultancy service and worked closely with the analytics team and they gave us insights that we would have naturally ignored and these insights ended up being our guiding factor on how we can grow the business. A few details about them is which outlet is actually having some troubles, also how many complaints we’re getting, how many rejections we’re getting, at which time does the kitchen prep time increase, what are the different kinds of customers we’re getting, what is our repeat rate, what is our reorder rate. Normally this data would be reviewed on a monthly basis — I put in features using the Power BI dashboard that we created. The features had real-time data and the data was uploaded within a day and the next day we knew if there were any discrepancies which was reviewed by the area manager and then sent out to me which I discussed with the area manager and then we had a conversation with the different staff members or the product team if any changes were needed.
The 5 kitchen formats were:
1.	Cloud Kitchen
2.	Café
3.	Food Court
4.	Takeaway
5.	Kiosk
For a cloud kitchen we wanted a location with high density and in these locations usually the markets have high rentals as well so cloud kitchens were a good option and we looked for high density areas but cheaper markets where the footfall wasn’t that much so we went to tier 3 markets with a lot of offices and a little older in age where we could get the rentals low while catering to delivery as well as have a bigger space to handle huge volumes. A café would be something where a traditional market space is available and we have access to the crowd — usually on the ground floor where people were willing to sit. Food courts were inside corporate offices or universities like Cybercity and Amity University and here we subsidized the rates a bit to compete with other counters. Takeaway counters were in high-footfall walking markets where people grab-wrap-and-go. A kiosk we did inside Zomato office initially and one inside a grocery store where people could interact with a 360 degree station.
When we started up, we knew we needed time to establish a brand. When we started up, we knew that we needed some time to establish a brand in the market, especially in locations we didn’t exist in, and we knew our sales were going to be minimal until we could do so. So instead of going to bigger established malls where the rentals were skyrocketed and skyrocket our burn rate, we decided to go with newer commercial spaces and got into a profit sharing or revenue sharing model. This was a mutually beneficial relationship with the builder itself because where we had opened up there were not a lot of restaurants and we were one of the initial restaurants so even the people who did visit we had huge exposure and we had huge opportunity to convince and grasp new customers.
My biggest contribution I would say was to introduce data into the culture. The promoters of the organization have been in the restaurant business through generations. They were from the Kwality family and they had a certain way of doing things which involved a lot of intuitiveness, a lot of things that you have to take casually. But with the evolving domain of online delivery and the data availability, very early in the picture I introduced a data science team where they used to give us insights about a lot of different things which helped us be very proactive. They did have a culture of looking at data — the sales figures, and which product is selling more — but that was more or less it. They used to do it at the end of the month. When we introduced our Power BI dashboard and we had a lot of data from the different kinds of customer segments that we had, who is buying what, which product is increasing in sales, and we used to do it almost every four or five days. So there was a lag of two days in getting that data online, but we could proactively see which outlet is doing what. Along with that, we also had information about kitchen prep time, order delays, order returns, complaints, etc., which gave us insights about which of the staff members needs to be better trained, which staff member was doing very well. And we could play on the strengths instead of just pushing and reallocate them within the different stores and play on the strengths. A few people were very good at communicating, but ended up spending their time in the cloud kitchen. So we did shift him to a customer-facing role with a high footfall, and hence he used to do minimal cooking, but a lot of customer interaction. A person was there in the night shift, and his kitchen prep time was amazing. So we actually shifted him around, put him in peak hour of the dinner hour, and that is when he was able to deliver a lot of orders in a very minimal time. That is when our delays went down.
So back in Pita Pit, when we did get the confidence that a product aligns with the needs of our target customers, we decided to expand rapidly. Our aim was to get noticed by the crowd of Delhi NCR, without putting a lot of load on any one particular outlet. We knew that our capacity per outlet is very low. So, we wanted our brand to overall develop. Hence, we decided to instead of opening one or two big outlets, we decided to open a lot of smaller outlets and we had a rolling outlet deployment strategy where every one and a half, two months we were launching a different outlet. This was hard given that the workforce was untrained. There were not a lot of experienced people within the brand, the brand being relatively new. And for this, we standardized the implementation process, be it operationally, marketing-wise, and training-wise. These three aspects were very important and standardizing them through documentation as well as allocating responsibility for the area manager or the operations head or me was very important. Creating a well-defined responsibility structure and holding them accountable for whenever something is going wrong became very important.
We knew we had this plan in mind which is why even when we had one cloud kitchen everything we did, we documented it and tried to create structure to all the actions that we were taking. We did deep analysis behind every single decision we took. Even things that radically didn’t matter in a cloud kitchen — like communication inserts that we were putting into our orders or our billboard styling or density of light — we put a lot of thought behind it. We worked with good graphic designers, hired expensive food photographers because we knew that down the line everything that we were doing will become very important when we start our expansion journey. I’ll give an example: When we were doing about ₹4000 to ₹5000 daily sales in the beginning and we were using pictures clicked by other countries given to us by the Central Canada team, we knew that many of these pictures did not resonate with the Indian market. So instead of getting a normal food photographer and just getting the pictures done and pushing them in the market, we spent a lot of money to get it done which was equivalent to about two months of sale that we could have done from that outlet. So it would not make sense if we just had to continue the cloud kitchen but given that we knew that we can monetize these pictures when launching more outlets, it made sense. It was a little hard to convince my boss initially but once he started looking everything futuristically that is when we got the budget approval.
When we launched an outlet, there was a lot of hype around it, especially for locations where not a lot of things were open — newer malls, markets where a cloud kitchen was there. But this used to slowly die down only after, say, three or four weeks. And that is when we realized that we could do a lot of local, on-ground activity to keep the hype going. We used to do online ads on Zomato and Swiggy as well as social media ads on Instagram and Facebook. But then we realized that not a lot of these ads were being translated to physical presence within the store. So we decided to go the traditional way and do a lot of on-ground activity. This involved everything from tying up with the local newspaper vendor to do newspaper inserts and banners, posters. We also had a few people stand on the road and distribute the menu and direct them towards the outlet. We also did coupons for OnePlus One that were distributed to the people in the market and we wrote the time where it was being distributed and the validity was only one hour. These activities were costly, so we needed to understand if we were actually getting anything out of them. We implemented it in one outlet on SPR road and compared data to a similar outlet launched 6 months ago. Despite same area density, similar layout, space & products, we got a lot of initial footfall. Some customers mentioned carrying physical coupons. We replicated Zomato/Swiggy ad campaigns in Baani Square & Elan to isolate effects. We got ~70% more walk-ins and allocated ~30% effect to on-ground activation.
We catered to parties, lunches, store launches, events etc: Elan, Suncity, American Express, Zomato launch parties. We sent out emails to HR and admin heads asking for a call. Sometimes offered 40% off. Got samples delivered. We put in a placard communicating freshly cut veggies, cooked with no oil, high protein, etc. Gave complimentary hummus bowls. We lost money on these but saw huge direct orders afterward.
Some outlets in food courts did very well. We realized we could decrease rates because of shared costs (no delivery, lower commissions, shared seating). To replicate in normal outlets, we went around markets physically with pamphlets of our corporate program. We targeted small offices (brokerage firms, law firms, design studios). We offered them a membership where employees got 10–15% discount between 11am–3pm. Validation of employment via visiting card, then fed into POS. This built a customer database used for WhatsApp promotions.
We launched campaigns with Zomato & Swiggy where we got a lot of visibility — sometimes 10× sales. We prepared capacity to be temporarily expandable. We mobilized workflows. Implemented bulk-order SOPs during peak visibility. Wastage increased ~20–30%, but acquired many customers. Standardization maintained 95% service quality.
Zomato Quick was piloting near their HQ; chose us for proximity and relationship. We gave them insights on feasibility, improving the product. Helped shape Zomato Quick campaign factors.
Individual outlets didn’t hold negotiating power on commissions. Zomato/Swiggy had rigid policies. But due to our relationship, once we showed expansion strategy and growth rate, they reduced commission bands and amended contracts manually.
When we initially launched our website-based ordering system, we had acquisition issues. Even loyal customers ordered via Zomato/Swiggy. So we launched WhatsApp-based system through FoodPay. Customer messages → chatbot → auto-fill details → redirect to website → product selection → payment. Offered additional discounts. FoodPay tied us with last-mile partners (Porter, Dunzo, etc.). This cut out middlemen and commissions. We also sent timed WhatsApp notifications.
Initially pricing was cost-based. We realized customers were value-sensitive, not price-sensitive. If perceived value increased (protein, quality), they were willing to pay more. So we segmented menu based on protein, introduced Extra Healthy menu (50% more protein), added air-fried fries, air-fried falafel, protein shakes. Used price discrimination based on value. Increased AOV 15–20%.
We were expanding quickly and losing control. We introduced more data matrices:
– Customer data: discrepancies, qualitative reviews, repeat rate, dropout, location & daypart.
– Menu/Sales data: SKU performance, modification needs.
– Operational data: delays, staff performance, training gaps.
Tracking via Power BI let us proactively fix issues.
A key insight: Product depreciated heavily from 40 to 60 mins after prep. Delays majorly hurt CX. Actions: training, procedural SOPs for 2–6 order scenarios, delay-order strategy, training new joiners at high-volume outlets, discounting/advertising to flatten peak hours.
Our social media ideology was not niche health — we wanted relatability. We used hyperlocal influencers across travel, lifestyle, vlogs, comedy, fashion, fitness. Given budget constraints & localization ideology, many were micro-influencers known within their area. Mostly barter deals (free meals). Videos reaching 50k+ bumped online orders.
Compared to other restaurants, our wastage was high because of display SOPs. We introduced Zero Waste Challenge with cash prizes. Managers innovated: decreasing cambro size, proactive timing based on office closing hours. Decreased wastage ~30%, increased accountability.
5 experts were in marketing, operations, finance, design, chef. Canadian SOPs were unimplementable in India. We standardised and modified everything. Created branding booklet (fonts, colours, communication, brand story, limits on humour/political/socio-economic content). Operational playbook included documentation, SOPs, sanitary guidelines, safety, storage time limits, date-tagging, etc.
After all the documentation and menu engineering, we needed to validate our hypotheses and try to understand what further improvements can be done in the menu. So for this, we held a run of pop-ups where we went to different gyms, corporates, as well as residences, put temporary stalls. This not only gave us insights from our early customers who were very open and we also pushed them for feedback but also validated some of our SOPs in the operations where we understood how we can actually handle the peak times and what procedural changes need to be made, which further initiated changes in our operational playbook, our SOPs and menu engineering.
So with the extent to which our preparation actually increased, our original plan of the promoters was to start one outlet every three or four months but with the increased information and market validation through the pilot programs we were able to get it down by about 30 percent. So our expansion roadmap got changed and got more concentrated to the beginning. Of course the first outlet was proof-of-concept, but following outlets were implemented at a rapid pace.
We realized that a lot of people had stayed in countries like Canada, US, Paris, Australia, New Zealand. And there would be some people who would recognize the brand. So we started launching our social media campaigns early on, even before we launched. And many of these videos got engagement through customers that had experienced Pita Pit before from other countries. This gave us additional boost. Along with this, we also did targeted WhatsApp campaigns as soon as we launched. And this enabled us to establish a customer base even before we entered the market.
Boosted gross profit by 3% by negotiating Zomato & Swiggy commissions down to 22–24% (vs. 27% industry average), improving outlet-level margins — I want to replace this pointer with another point, use the content that I have given you and come up with a different point altogether that does not coincide with my current resume.
You have gained a lot of understanding about my experiences and the different things I did at the role of Growth Lead as well as GTM Manager at Pita Pit. Try to bring out best stories that I can use in my interview and implement them in different questions asked during the interview. Give them to me in a summary format. Communication, Decision making, Initiative, Organization, Time management, Flexibility, Leadership, Problem solving — cover 2 aspects in each story.
The stories I have selected are:
– pivot from malls to targeted locations such as offices, food courts, markets, universities etc
– creating provisions for spike in visibility that increased our orders to about 5 or 10x
– multi-format kitchen model
– zero waste challenge
– pilot testing for validating assumptions
– menu modifications to input premium food to use price discrimination
along with few you don’t know about I will tell them in the next prompt.
Do you know these otherwise I tell you: Manager not wanting to spend a lot of money on the photography initially as we only had one cloud kitchen but my outlook was these photographs can be used for the upcoming outlets. The budget looked unjustified given our sales. Should I continue?
To validate my assumptions and prove to my manager, I got the approval to hire a graphic designer to redo one of the pictures we clicked for a new product we were launching — Paneer Tikka. Once listed, this product skyrocketed and became our third-highest bestseller within two weeks. That is when we realized that because we are running an online store, product perception is widely driven by the photograph. Importance of pictures was seen by my manager and the fund was allocated within one month and we got the photoshoot done, increasing sales in subsequent months. I knew my manager was number-centric and he would validate my assumption only if we had proof. So to test my hypothesis, I took one of the products we were going to launch and hired a graphic designer to touch up the image.
Another story: After our second outlet we realized a trend in sales pattern. Our customers are not price sensitive. This value is subjective and changes from customer to customer. So we tried to segment them into three categories (already described). We realized some of these customers were price sensitive, but others focused on the protein content and justified price based on that. This motivated us to launch a category of Extra Healthy — 50–60% more protein in veg and non-veg. We also introduced air-fried sides including air-fried french fries and air-fried falafel along with protein shakes. These allowed us to increase our AOV by about 15–20% and allowed customers to order a full meal.
So the situation I want to mention here is that I realized that for digital-first companies, especially in an industry as competitive as QSRs, there was an issue with increasing brand perception, especially competing with brands who have a huge physical presence like Starbucks where you still pay ₹300 for a coffee even if delivered because you've seen the value. For digital-first companies it's hard — customers have never seen how food is created, the environment, machinery, people. That’s why we faced increased complaints. I realized this when reading complaints — one was a spillage complaint for a single drop of sauce. This was industry-wide, but we faced it more. Issue was lack of connection to the person preparing food. Though our packaging communicated “no oil used, freshly prepared,” we wanted to go a step forward. We printed out cards for each kitchen associate and each order they prepared they used to insert this card. The card had a picture of them, brand communication, their story, and a QR code redirecting to our Instagram page where everyone got a reel showing their life story, how they came into cooking, families, hobbies. This made customers feel emotional connect, increasing perceived value. This brought down complaints significantly and we didn’t realize it was working until reviews mentioned “spent a good time watching the reel while having my wrap.” This also increased Instagram followers and repeat customers.
Protein shake story: we could not fit in the smoothie maker due to limitation of space but then at a trip to Goa I saw a small counter serving a lot of cocktails using just a shaker. That inspired me to create a shaker-based protein shake SOP and product line.
By launching the brand within India, we wanted to understand what is the potential of the brand and hence we came up with this model where we made a plan to execute all across India and starting from NCR and the states that we are going to incrementally enter. Our plan involved the launch of hundred outlets and involved growth to other verticals as well. It had systematic thresholds passing which we could enter a central manufacturing kitchen as well as our own distribution network etc. Eventually reducing the costs and getting the turnover up to 80 cr.
In our original financial structure, we realized that starting from NCR did have its demerits. One of them was that fixed cost, the rentals and overheads were all very high, getting a margin down to 10%. Our challenge was to get everything in line and create a better opportunity for margins. For that I redesigned the overall structure, decreased the size of outlets, created a more lean kitchen structure as well as formats to follow while doing rollouts. This is when I came up with the different kitchen designs that we ended up implementing and many of them were successful. Having these multiple restaurant formats not only enabled us to decrease costs but also helped us modify our offerings based on where we are serving and what our target segment is.
When we were given the kitchen plan for Pita Pit by the Canadian team, it was very machinery-heavy as well as investment-heavy. We analyzed ROIs, machine device ROIs, and understood which machines could be eliminated. We eliminated three machines like Milkshake Maker and the Chef Base. This reduced our menu mix a little but we compensated later by reintroducing items through more efficient low-cost POs.
We realized that after our second outlet our customer pattern was segmented heavily around protein needs and value perception. That influenced our decision to launch the premium menu line, which improved our average order values. With the introduction of menu engineering and new products, we needed a proper framework to test, validate and launch. That is why the pop-ups became an important part of the process. After our pop-ups at gyms, corporates, and residential complexes we collected a lot of feedback and understood the pressure points of our SOPs and the operational constraints that we had to solve before rapidly scaling. These pilot tests helped us refine the entire GTM roadmap, especially for the first wave of NCR store launches.
With increased information and operational clarity from the pilot programs, our expansion roadmap changed drastically, becoming more concentrated toward the beginning. The promoters originally wanted to do one outlet every 3–4 months, but we brought this down by 30% and started implementing new outlets faster and more efficiently. The first outlet was proof-of-concept, but the rollout pace increased significantly after operational knowledge increased. We had specialized expertise in decision making, location strategy, menu structure, operational flow, and marketing sequencing.
We also realized that many customers had lived abroad and recognized Pita Pit from countries like Canada, USA, France, Australia, New Zealand, so we launched pre-launch digital campaigns to build recognition. Early social media reels brought in comments from people who had eaten Pita Pit abroad. Along with WhatsApp marketing these helped us establish a customer base even before opening.
We had times where Zomato and Swiggy campaigns increased visibility by 5–10×. That’s when we created temporary capacity expansions in the kitchen. We had bulk order SOPs, reassigned manpower, allowed slightly increased wastage as a tradeoff for massive demand. We wanted to leverage the visibility fully and convert new customers. We kept service quality above 95%.
Zomato Quick pilot was big because it was happening near their headquarters and four of our stores were nearby. They chose us due to our food profile and relationship. We discussed feasibility and improvements directly with their POCs and shaped their implementation. We had multiple points of conversation — what is implementable, what is not, what the kitchen can handle, what packaging changes are required.
When we looked at the commission structure, individual outlets did not have negotiating power. However, due to our relationship and growth plan and rapid expansion roadmap, we convinced the platforms to manually amend contract commissions downward. This is rare because Zomato/Swiggy usually keep commissions rigid and fixed after onboarding.
When we launched direct ordering via our website, acquisition was slow. Even loyal customers ordered from aggregators. So we added WhatsApp-based ordering using FoodPay. The system would auto-fill customer details from WhatsApp to the website, making ordering seamless. Additional discounts encouraged movement from aggregators to direct channels. FoodPay tied us with last mile partners like Porter, Dunzo, Swiggy, Delivery. Periodic lunch and dinner-time notifications boosted orders. We also used the POS database from food courts and the corporate program to run direct WhatsApp campaigns.
In the Extra Healthy menu we wanted to design high protein meals. We realized some customers would pay more for protein, not for taste. Aspirants looked for healthy-tasting alternatives, Intuitives valued freshness and flavor. This allowed us to price discriminate. Extra Healthy meals improved AOV by 15–20%.
We also realized product depreciation between 40–60 minutes drastically impacted customer experience. Complaints increased. We modified SOPs for multi-order processing (2, 3, 5, 6 order scenarios), implemented delay-processing strategies, introduced peak-hour training. New joiners were trained at high-volume stores to handle spikes. Discounting and ads flattened peak-hour spikes.
We understood digital-first brands struggle with brand perception compared to brands like Starbucks which customers trust even in delivery. Customers did not see our kitchen, staff, hygiene, cooking method, etc. That’s why we faced more micro-complaints. We printed customized cards for every kitchen associate with their face, story, QR code linking to their personal reel on Instagram showing their family, hobbies, origin, journey. This personalized connection improved perceived value, reduced complaints drastically, increased Instagram engagement. Customers mentioned watching the reels while eating wraps. This built a sense of community and trust.
We faced a problem while designing the menu because Indian kitchen formats did not allow space for a smoothie maker or blender. At a trip to Goa, I saw a shack using only shakers to prepare cocktails. This inspired me to design protein shakes using a shaker instead of a blender. We sourced powders that mix smoothly in a shaker, created SOPs for consistency, introduced multiple flavours. Protein shakes were launched with zero capex and contributed significantly to premiumization, allowing AOV uplift.
Our market entry design included a pan-India 100-outlet rollout plan. We wanted systematic thresholds to trigger investments in central kitchens, commissary units, and distribution networks. This would reduce input costs and improve profitability. This formed an ₹80 crore plan over 5 years.
Starting from NCR had demerits: higher rentals, higher fixed costs, pushing margins down to 10%. My challenge was to redesign the financial structure. I decreased outlet size, created leaner kitchen formats, removed heavy machinery, optimized the FOH/BOH layouts. Multiple formats (cloud kitchen, takeaway, kiosk, food court) reduced capex, matched target segments, and reduced payback period from 18 months to 12 months.
The Canadian kitchen plans were machinery-heavy. We removed three machines like Milkshake Maker and Chef Base. Reduced upfront costs and complexity. Later, reintroduced missing items through low-cost POs. ROI-focused machine selection allowed for better efficiency. Reduced unwanted equipment allowed us to reinvest in photography, menu testing, pilot programs, and customer experience improvements.
When launching pilots like pop-ups, we realized early adopters at gyms and corporates gave honest feedback. We tested flavour balance, portion sizes, texture, menu differentiation, operational SOPs. We found bottlenecks in multiple places including grill congestion, wrap assembly time, cutting timelines. All were fed into documentation and refined before scaling.
We also noticed our menu photographs were not resonating. Canadian images looked staged and mismatched Indian taste perception. Our sales were only ₹4000–₹5000/day at cloud kitchen stage. My manager refused a professional shoot because cost equaled nearly 2 months of sales. To prove the ROI, I created a test: Paneer Tikka image retouched by a designer. Once listed, it became our third highest selling SKU in 2 weeks. We realized photography impacts perception drastically. Manager understood importance and approved budget for full shoot. We used good photographers, food stylists, lighting experts. These images were reused across Zomato/Swiggy, signage, boards, marketing, expansion outlets.
We had kitchen staff reallocation based on strengths. For example, someone with strong prep time was shifted from night shift to peak dinner. Someone good in communication shifted to customer-facing outlet. This reduced delays drastically.
We also created corporate membership programs for local offices. Employees showed their visiting cards once and were added to POS. They got 10–15% discount at lunch. This increased lunchtime sales and reduced aggregator dependency. Some outlets discontinued due to overcrowding but customers continued coming.
We also ran many on-ground campaigns in new markets. Newspaper inserts, banners, posters, coupons valid for one hour. These activities created conversion spikes. In SPR Road outlet we compared data to similar outlet. We did conversion surveys asking “How did you get to know about us?” and allocated 30% uplift to ground activation.
We did sampling at Amex, Zomato, Elan, Suncity. Provided 40% discounts, free hummus bowls. Despite losing money on events, we saw huge direct orders afterwards.
We used many hyperlocal influencers (travel, vlog, comedy, fashion, fitness). Mostly barter because of limited budgets. Some reels hit 50k+ and caused spikes in orders.
We created SOPs for all processes, hygiene, food safety, labeling, time tracking, station setup, storage. Documentation stack increased to hundreds of pages across operations, marketing, branding, financial feasibility, design, FOH/BOH layouts.
All decisions were logged and analysis was done even for small choices like billboard lighting density and style. Many actions at cloud kitchen stage were foundation for expansion.
The promoters came from Kwality family with legacy operations. They used intuition. I introduced data-driven decision making. Monthly reports became daily dashboards. Every metric like complaints, delays, cancellations, prep times, SKU performance became actionable.


MASTER DATA BANK — PITA PIT
(Raw content consolidated, grammar-corrected only)
 
1. Role, Scope, and Team Structure
I was leading the strategy, growth, and GTM at Pita Pit.
Operations were headed by Manoj, Mohit was the General Manager, and Rajkumar and Shambhu were Area Heads who reported to Manoj and me.
The Food Quality & Innovation team was led by Ankush with two additional members.
The Data Analytics team consisted of Dheeraj and Komal, who worked as consultants and reported directly to me.
The Social Media team included Taha and Talha, who handled content creation, social media activation, influencer marketing, and graphic design.
Each outlet had a Store Manager, and some had Assistant Store Managers to manage two peak shifts.
My direct reports included Ankush, Dheeraj, Komal, Taha, Talha, Rajkumar, and Shambhu.
Effectively, I managed strategy across store teams (via Area Managers), social media, analytics, and food innovation.
 
2. Revenue Mix and Channels
Out of approximately ₹50L in revenue:
•	Zomato/Swiggy contributed ~70%
•	Walk-ins contributed ~20%
•	Corporate orders contributed ~5%
•	New marketing interventions contributed ~5%
 
3. Customer Segmentation & Core Insights
A. Affordability / Paying Power Segmentation
•	UM (₹400+): Ordered sides, premium items, low loyalty, high quality expectations
•	MM (₹250–400): Discount-responsive, consistency-sensitive, frequent orderers
•	LA (₹150–250): Highly discount-sensitive, low brand loyalty
B. Persona Segmentation
•	Health Freaks:
Care deeply about ingredients and protein grams, often order without sauces or dressings, value quality over taste.
•	Aspirants:
Want healthier alternatives without compromising taste. Avoid deep-fried food but are okay with carbs. Taste matters more than protein numbers.
•	Intuitives:
Order due to curiosity, freshness, flavor profiles, and innovation. Some are Lebanese food enthusiasts. They do not tolerate deliberate compromises in taste.
 
4. Marketing Actions Based on Insights
Retention for online orders was weak, especially when orders came via aggregators.
We introduced packaging inserts:
•	Orders under ₹350 received a pamphlet offering discounts for direct WhatsApp ordering via QR code.
•	Orders above ₹350 received a thank-you note designed to look handwritten (black-and-white photocopy).
Each cook had a personalized note style, and feedback was extremely positive.
 
5. Introduction of Data Culture
Within the first month, I introduced data-driven decision making.
We worked with a data consultancy and built Power BI dashboards that tracked:
•	Outlet-level performance
•	Complaints, rejections, delays
•	Prep time by time of day
•	Customer types, repeat rate, reorder rate
Instead of monthly reviews, data was reviewed every 4–5 days.
We used this data to:
•	Identify underperforming outlets
•	Reallocate staff based on strengths
•	Shift strong prep performers to peak hours
•	Move communication-oriented staff to customer-facing locations
 
6. Kitchen Formats and Location Strategy
We developed five formats:
1.	Cloud Kitchen
2.	Café
3.	Food Court
4.	Takeaway
5.	Kiosk
Cloud Kitchens were placed in high-density but lower-footfall markets with offices, allowing low rent and high delivery volumes.
Cafés were in traditional ground-floor markets with seating.
Food Courts were inside corporate hubs and universities like Cyber City and Amity University, with subsidized pricing due to shared infrastructure.
Takeaway outlets were placed in walking markets for impulse purchases.
Kiosks were tested inside offices (Zomato) and grocery stores with 360-degree visibility.
 
7. Market Entry & Expansion Philosophy
Instead of entering expensive malls early, we chose:
•	Newer commercial spaces
•	Revenue-share / profit-share models
This lowered burn and gave us higher visibility as early tenants.
We adopted a rolling rollout strategy, launching a new outlet every 1.5–2 months instead of opening large flagship stores.
All actions, even during the single cloud kitchen phase, were documented with scale in mind.
 
8. Photography Investment Story
Initial sales were ₹4–5K/day.
The manager refused a professional photoshoot because the cost equaled nearly two months of sales.
To prove ROI, I hired a graphic designer to enhance the image of a new SKU (Paneer Tikka).
Once listed, it became the third-highest selling product within two weeks.
This proved that product perception online is driven primarily by photography.
Within a month, the photography budget was approved, and the images were reused across all future outlets and marketing assets.
 
9. On-Ground Marketing & Corporate Sales
Launch hype faded after 3–4 weeks, so we ran on-ground activations:
•	Newspaper inserts
•	Banners and posters
•	Staff distributing menus
•	One-hour validity BOGO coupons
At the SPR Road outlet, we compared results with a similar older outlet and saw ~70% higher walk-ins, with ~30% attributed to on-ground activity.
We catered to events at Elan, Suncity, American Express, Zomato, etc.
We offered samples, up to 40% discounts, complimentary hummus bowls.
Although these events lost money initially, they drove large volumes of direct corporate orders later.
 
10. Corporate Lunch Program
Food court outlets performed well due to lower costs.
To replicate this, we launched a corporate membership program:
•	10–15% lunch discounts (11am–3pm)
•	Validation via visiting card
•	Data stored in POS
This boosted lunch sales and built a WhatsApp marketing database.
 
11. Platform Campaigns & Surge Handling
Zomato and Swiggy campaigns increased visibility by 5–10x.
We:
•	Activated bulk-order SOPs
•	Reallocated manpower
•	Accepted temporary wastage (20–30%)
Despite surges, we maintained 95% service quality.
We were early partners in Zomato Quick, gave feasibility feedback, and helped shape implementation.
 
12. Direct Ordering via WhatsApp
Customers preferred aggregators even when loyal.
We launched a WhatsApp ordering flow via FoodPay:
•	Auto-filled details
•	Website redirection
•	Integrated last-mile partners
Discounts and timed notifications drove adoption.
 
13. Pricing, Menu Engineering & Premiumization
Pricing was initially cost-based.
We discovered customers were value-sensitive, not price-sensitive.
We launched an Extra Healthy category:
•	50–60% more protein
•	Veg and non-veg options
•	Air-fried fries and falafel
•	Protein shakes
This enabled price discrimination, increased AOV by 15–20%, and shifted customers toward full-meal orders.
 
14. Operational Data & Delay Reduction
We tracked:
•	Customer feedback
•	SKU performance
•	Staff efficiency
We identified that food quality depreciated sharply after 40–60 minutes.
Actions taken:
•	Multi-order SOPs (2–6 orders)
•	Delay-handling strategies
•	Peak-hour training
•	Demand smoothing via discounts and ads
 
15. Zero Waste Challenge
Freshness SOPs caused high wastage.
We launched a Zero Waste Challenge with incentives.
Managers innovated by:
•	Reducing container sizes
•	Cutting closer to peak demand times
Wastage reduced by ~30–34%.
 
16. Humanizing the Digital-First Brand
Digital-first brands lack trust compared to physical brands like Starbucks.
Minor issues triggered complaints (e.g., one drop of sauce).
We introduced chef story cards:
•	Photo + personal story
•	QR code linking to Instagram reels
This built emotional connection, reduced complaints, increased repeat orders, and grew Instagram organically.
 
17. Protein Shake Innovation
Kitchen layouts had no space for a blender.
During a trip to Goa, I saw cocktails made using shakers.
Inspired by this, we:
•	Created shaker-based protein shake SOPs
•	Sourced smooth-mixing powders
•	Launched multiple flavors
This required zero capex and supported premiumization.
 
18. Financial Model & Expansion Plan
We built a ₹80 Cr, 5-year, 100-outlet plan:
•	NCR-first, then state-wise expansion
•	Threshold-based triggers for central kitchen and distribution
•	Focus on reducing costs via vertical integration
 
19. Margin & Payback Optimization
Starting from NCR meant high rentals and margins ~10%.
I:
•	Reduced outlet size
•	Created lean kitchen formats
•	Removed high-capex machines (Chef Base, Milkshake Maker, etc.)
Payback reduced from 18 months to 12 months.
Removed items were later reintroduced via low-cost processes.
 
20. SOPs, Documentation & Governance
We worked with experts in marketing, ops, finance, design, and culinary.
Canadian SOPs were unfit for India.
We created:
•	Branding booklets
•	Communication guidelines
•	Operational playbooks
•	Hygiene and safety SOPs
•	Storage and labeling protocols
All decisions, even small ones, were documented with scale in mind.
21. Decision-Making Framework You Followed (Implicit but Not Articulated Earlier)
Most of your decisions followed a 3-layer framework, even if it was not formally named:
1.	Customer Perception First
o	How will the customer interpret this decision digitally vs physically?
o	Will this increase perceived value, trust, or convenience?
2.	Unit Economics Second
o	Does this improve AOV, reduce fixed costs, or shorten payback?
o	If it increases cost, can it be reused across multiple outlets?
3.	Scalability Third
o	Can this be standardized?
o	Can this be documented and handed over to future teams?
This framework governed decisions such as:
•	photography investment
•	multi-format kitchens
•	premium menu introduction
•	humanizing the brand
•	pop-up pilots
•	WhatsApp ordering
 
22. How You Personally Managed Trade-offs (Cost vs Growth vs Quality)
You consciously accepted controlled inefficiencies in specific cases:
•	Higher wastage during visibility spikes to protect service quality
•	Loss-making corporate sampling to acquire long-term direct customers
•	Expensive photography during low sales phase for long-term asset creation
But you never allowed inefficiency to become structural:
•	All temporary losses were tied to learning, exposure, or asset creation
•	Permanent costs were aggressively optimized (rentals, machinery, kitchen size)
 
23. How You Influenced Senior Stakeholders Without Formal Authority
You rarely pushed decisions emotionally.
Your influence style was:
•	Run small experiments
•	Generate proof
•	Present outcomes, not opinions
Examples:
•	Paneer Tikka photo experiment
•	Pilot pop-ups before rollout
•	Corporate program tested in selective outlets
•	Kitchen format validation before scale
This made senior leadership comfortable backing decisions even when they initially disagreed.
 
24. Your Role in Aligning Old-School Operators With Digital Thinking
The promoters came from a legacy restaurant background with:
•	intuition-led decision making
•	monthly reviews
•	physical-store mindset
You acted as a bridge by:
•	translating data into operational language
•	not overwhelming them with dashboards
•	focusing on “what action changes tomorrow?”
You never positioned data as replacing intuition — only augmenting it.
 
25. Risk Management Approach (Unstated Earlier)
You reduced risk by:
•	Testing ideas in one outlet before rollout
•	Running pilots in non-core formats (pop-ups, food courts)
•	Isolating variables when comparing performance (SPR Road example)
•	Introducing SOP buffers before visibility campaigns
You avoided “big bang” launches without learnings.
 
26. Why Lunch Became Strategically Important (Not Explicitly Framed Earlier)
You realized lunch:
•	Had more predictable demand
•	Had higher repeat probability
•	Was less influenced by indulgence-based competition
•	Allowed corporate and membership programs
This is why you:
•	shifted focus from dinner-heavy malls
•	built corporate lunch programs
•	designed pricing for midday meals
•	optimized prep time for lunch rush
 
27. Your Role in Talent Development (Beyond Reallocation)
You indirectly built talent capability by:
•	rotating staff across formats
•	exposing new joiners to high-volume kitchens
•	rewarding innovation (zero waste challenge)
•	creating accountability through visibility (data dashboards)
This reduced dependency on hiring “experienced” staff.
 
28. How You Thought About Brand vs Performance Marketing
You clearly differentiated:
•	Performance marketing → conversions, discounts, visibility
•	Brand marketing → trust, familiarity, emotional connection
Actions like:
•	chef story cards
•	influencer authenticity over reach
•	premium photography
•	pre-launch campaigns
were brand investments, not short-term sales tactics.
 
29. Your Implicit GTM Philosophy
Your GTM approach was:
•	enter markets quietly
•	learn fast
•	standardize aggressively
•	then scale rapidly
You did not chase vanity launches.
You chased repeatable playbooks.
 
30. What Makes Your Experience Unusual (Meta Insight)
Most candidates:
•	optimize one outlet
•	or do only marketing
•	or only ops
Your experience is unusual because you:
•	designed the system
•	tested it
•	scaled it
•	corrected it mid-flight
•	and documented it for future teams
You operated closer to a founder / GM mindset than a functional role.
 
31. How This Maps to Google / P&G (Implicit but Useful)
Without changing your story:
•	Google sees market entry, GTM, data-driven growth, experimentation
•	P&G sees customer understanding, portfolio pricing, distribution logic, discipline
You don’t need different stories — only different emphasis.
